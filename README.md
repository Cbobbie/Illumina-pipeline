# Illumina Pipeline
This repository contains the NGS pipeline used for the second chapter of my M.Sc. thesis. Note that this is the pipeline ONLY, and does not include any further statistical analysis. 

## Dataset
The data from this pipeline are publically available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, under the project ID: PRJNA297448.

## Skills
This project relies heavily on python coding expertise, and incorporates several github .py shells from other users. Credit for these additional shells are given in the Illumina-pipeline.py script.

## Complete Analysis
Complete analysis for this project can be found in my M.Sc. thesis and several published manuscripts.
